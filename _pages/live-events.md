<h2><strong>LIVE EVENTS</strong></h2>
<strong>Travel Thursday – Thursday, October 29 @ 3:00 p.m.</strong>

The Center for International Education hosts a special Thursday edition of their popular “Travel Tuesday” series!  The decision to participate, and finance, an education aboard program often involves the whole family, not just the student.  Join the Center for International Education for a virtual Family Weekend panel!  Two recent study abroad alumni will be accompanied by their parents to discuss the study abroad process from their points of view. Access the live session through Zoom:  <a href="http://Travel Thursday Zoom session">https://umw-sso.zoom.us/j/84940201547?pwd=WVJvTnFESVB6aWhEWmJMRmRybmhIQT09 </a>
