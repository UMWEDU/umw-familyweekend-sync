<h2>Lyrics</h2>
Soar Eagles soar
March on to victory!
Represent the heights
With pride and loyalty.
We wear the grey and blue
Our honor pure and true.
So fight on Mary Washington,
Soar Eagle Nation Soar!
U.M. Double U! We rule the nest! (That’s right!)
U.M. Double U! We are the best! (Go Pride!)
U.M. Double U! We rule the nest! (That’s right!)
Go! Fight! Soar!
Soar Eagles soar
High above the heights
Score just one more time
Fly on to victory!
Our grey and eagle blue
Is mighty to the core!
So fight on Mary Washington
Soar Eagle soar!
U.M. Double U! We rule the nest! (That’s right!)
U.M. Double U! We are the best! (Go Pride!)
U.M. Double U! We rule the nest! (That’s right!)
Go! Fight! Soar!
