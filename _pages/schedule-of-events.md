<h4 style="text-align: center">Stay tuned for the 2020 Family Weekend schedule!  Below is the 2019 schedule.</h4>
</blockquote>
Although we are not able to welcome families in person, University of Mary Washington is still celebrating our annual fall tradition via our first <em>virtual</em> Family Weekend.  This virtual weekend of festivities is aimed at bringing a glimpse of student life to family and friends.  All featured content is at <u>no cost</u> and, with the exception of a few events, can be viewed at any time.  We encourage families and students to find time to connect in new ways and participate in these events and activities together.  No matter the circumstances, it’s always a great day to be an Eagle!
